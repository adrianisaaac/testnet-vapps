## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: ProofMesh
- **Category**: identity

### Description
ProofMesh is a ZK middleware layer that makes zero-knowledge proofs easy to integrate into any application.

Developers often struggle with ZK adoption due to its complexity and high learning curve. ProofMesh solves this by offering a plug & play SDK/API where dApps can generate and verify proofs without needing to understand cryptography.

From identity (unique user proofs), DeFi (private position checks), gaming (fair play verification), to social (zk reputation), ProofMesh enables developers to integrate privacy and trust seamlessly.

### SL Integration
- Proof Anchoring: All ZK proofs generated by ProofMesh are anchored on the Soundness Layer (SL).
- Selective Disclosure: dApps can verify proof types (e.g., “isUniqueUser”) without seeing raw data.
- Cross-dApp Interoperability: Proofs created once can be reused across DAOs, DeFi, or games through SL.

## Technical

### Architecture
- Proof Request → dApp requests proof via SDK (e.g., uniqueness, reputation, balance check).
- Proof Generator → ProofMesh compiles proof using ZK circuits.
- SL Anchor → Proof is anchored and verified on Soundness Layer.
- Verifier SDK → Other dApps can simply call proofmesh.verify("isUniqueUser")
### Stack
- **Frontend**: React (for developer dashboard & example integrations)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Rust (proof generation engine)
- **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer + EVM compatibility
- **Storage**: IPFS + WALRUS (for off-chain data commitments)

### Features
1. Plug & Play SDK for ZK proofs
2. Cross-dApp Proof Reuse via SL anchoring
3. Developer Dashboard for proof management
4. Identity Proofs (unique human, reputation)
5. DeFi Proofs (private liquidity/position checks)
6. Gaming Proofs (fair game states)

## Timeline

### PoC (3 weeks)
- [ ] Build SDK prototype for proof requests
- [ ] Integrate SL proof anchoring
- [ ] Demo with basic “unique user” proof

### MVP (6 weeks)
- [ ] Expand proofs: identity, DeFi, gaming
- [ ] Developer dashboard for proof lifecycle
- [ ] Full SL integration for selective disclosure
- [ ] Testnet deployment with sample dApps

## Innovation
ProofMesh redefines how developers adopt ZK :
- No need for deep cryptography knowledge
- Universal SDK/API usable across categories
- Anchored on SL for maximum interoperability
-Bridges gap between advanced ZK tech and everyday Web3 developers
