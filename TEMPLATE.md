## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: Identiq
- **Category**: identity

### Description
SoundnessLabs is a decentralized identity and reputation layer that enables users to own their identity, prove credibility across dApps, and protect privacy with verifiable credentials and zero-knowledge proofs.
It solves the lack of trust and reputation in Web3 by allowing portable, privacy-preserving reputation across multiple applications.

### SL Integration  
- Use Soundness Layer (SL) for authentication, credential verification, and event auditing.
- SL will act as the settlement & verification backbone for issuing and validating identity proofs.
- Reputation updates will be recorded and verified through SL modules.

## Technical

### Architecture
User Wallet → SoundnessLabs ID Contract → Settlement Layer (SL) → dApp Authentication & Reputation Check

### Stack
- Frontend: React + Next.js (user dashboard & login widget)
- Backend: Node.js (API & middleware)
- Blockchain: SL + EVM-compatible chains
- Storage: IPFS/Ceramic for credential metadata, on-chain hashes for verification

### Features
1. Decentralized Identity (DID) → self-sovereign identity controlled by the user.
2. Verifiable Credentials → portable, tamper-proof reputation proofs.
3. Reputation Scoring → dynamic reputation score based on user’s activities.
4. Privacy-Preserving Proofs → ZKPs to prove reputation without exposing all data.
5. “Sign in with SoundnessLabs” widget → easy dApp integration.

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Basic DID smart contract
- [ ] SL integration for credential verification
- [ ] Simple UI for identity creation

### MVP (4-8 weeks)  
- [ ] Full verifiable credential issuance & verification
- [ ] Reputation scoring system
- [ ] User dashboard & dApp login widget
- [ ] Beta release on testnet

## Innovation
- Unlike standard wallet login, SoundnessLabs provides trust & reputation portability across dApps.
- Integrates zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification.
- Bridges the gap between identity, reputation, and usability in Web3.
